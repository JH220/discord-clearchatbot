A feature-rich Discord moderation bot for channel management and moderation.

## About ClearChat Bot

The ClearChat bot is a sleek **Discord moderation bot** that focuses on **channel moderation**. Discord does not offer a proper **bulk deletion** feature on its own. Thus, the user has to laboriously delete each message individually.
Since [we](https://github.com/jh220de/ccbot/graphs/contributors) were also missing this feature ourselves, we decided to provide a **simple and easy** way to get around this problem. The bot allows the user to delete messages in a channel by executing a **simple command** (`/clear`). In addition to that, there are some new additional features like filtering by various parameters, such as the **amount**, a specific **user or role**, as well as filtering messages generated by **bots**.
