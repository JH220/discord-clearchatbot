A feature-rich moderation bot of your Discord server for channel management and structuring your chat.

## About ClearChat Bot

The ClearChat bot is a classic **Discord moderation bot** that focuses on **channel managing**. Discord does not offer a proper **bulk deletion** on its own, which requires the user to delete each message individually.
Since we were also missing this feature ourselves, we provide a **simple and easy** way to surround this problem. This allows the user to delete messages in a channel by a **simple command**, even with some new additional features like filtering by various parameters, such as the **amount**, a specific **user or role**, as well as filtering messages generated by **bots**.

## Hosted version [![Discord Bots](https://i.ibb.co/yW5HSRC/verified.png)](https://jh220.de/ccbot)

We offer a **public hosted version** of the **ClearChat bot** to reach the largest possible user base.<br>
This **sharded instance** is completely **free of charge** and offers free **support** on our [Discord](https://jh220.de/cc/help) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ccbot:jh220.de) server.
