## Privacy

ClearChatBot may log your server name, ID and the date of the join.
Other permissions can be configured using roles.
Keep in mind that owners and internal developers of the ClearChatBot could,
theoretically, read all the messages and do everything with your server
and channels, so it's in your interest to manage the bot's permissions.
